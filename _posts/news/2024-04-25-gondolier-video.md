Hi there! Here comes the second single and video from
[Further Afield](/further-afield/)! It's called Gondolier. It's a doozy - hope
you like it!

About the song: We've been threatening to make a dance record for years. In
fact, we've probably begun every record thinking it'd be cool to make a dance
record. But our innate sensibilities take over and ... <!--more--> it just comes
out as +/- {Plus/Minus}. Nothing wrong with that - but what if we actually stuck
to it? So this was one of those attempts. As it happened, James bought this
little keyboard, the
[Teenage Engineering OP-Z](https://teenage.engineering/products/op-z) and let
his son have a go one morning. The initial loop was the first thing his son came
up with. James took this and used it as the basis of the song.

Initially, the skeleton of the song was just a couple of verses and then a long
instrumental solo created on the OP-Z. James reworked the verses a bit, came up
with the melody, and adjusted the instrumental to build more and it seemed like
that would be it... but we still felt the song had somewhere else to go... where
we went was an electronic world of synthesizers and drum machines while still
keeping our 4-on-the-floor beat. Lots of vocals! Oohs and Aahs! We thought we
were done (it was probably a reasonable 5 minute song at this
point), but James had one more section to dance to. Things quieted down... we
tried to throw in as many acoustic instruments as we had into the mix. At nearly
7 minutes, this is the longest song we've ever written. We count it among our
best. Hope you like it!

About the video: Given the (ahem) epic nature of the song, we thought the video
deserved a similar treatment. We shot in the same location on 3 different days
in 3 different seasons - trying our best to maintain the same basic shot in
each. We also planned out where everyone would need to stand if the "extra
players" arrived on screen. Lots of fun was had... lots of food was eaten. Hands
got cold, the doppelgangers became unruly, but we think we pulled it off. Big
thanks to Doug Choi for shooting and generally helping us conceptualize this
video.
