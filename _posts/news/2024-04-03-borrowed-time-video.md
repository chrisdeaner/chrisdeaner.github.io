Today we are releasing the first single from our upcoming release. Borrowed Time
is the first track on the forthcoming full-length release
[Further Afield](/further-afield/). We are also premiering the video! Check it

The video was shot in near total darkness on a Pixel 7 Pro using the
astrophotography mode. We discovered this mode while shooting photos on the
beach in Montauk in the early hours (3am) the late of Chris' birthday. The look
of the resulting loops were quick unique, and so we set up to make an entire
video comprised of these shots. It took quite a while though, as each second of
video took nearly 4 mins to shoot.

Check out the video below:

Fun fact, the photo still from that night can be found in the cover art for
[Further Afield](/further-afield/). Can you find them? High res version of the
