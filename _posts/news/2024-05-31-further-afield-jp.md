Great news! After being delayed in customs for a bit, we finally have a few
Japanese Import CDs in our posession, and available in the [store](/store). The
Japanese Edition is unique in that it also contains 5 extra songs from our
Summer 2019:Extended Play release.

We are super exicited to be able to make this release available to folks
stateside. We only have a few, so make sure to get your quickly!

If you are in Japan,
[order from 7ep](https://7eptokyo.bandcamp.com/album/further-afield-cd-digital)).

As always, thakns for your support!
