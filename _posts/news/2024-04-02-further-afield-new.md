We have some exciting new to share! On May 31st, 2024, we will be releasing our
sixth full-length album, [Further Afield](/further-afield/), our first LP in a decade. We think it's 
our best yet! It contains many of the hallmarks of a +/- {Plus/Minus} album, but, as always,
we're exploring new (for us) territory. Buckle up!

Hey there! Long time no see. Let's catch up, shall we?  

Itâ€™s been a while since our last full-length album,
[Jumping the Tracks](/jumping-the-tracks/) was unleashed upon the world. After
releasing that album, we were planning on releasing an EP every six months. Basically, 
we had a planto keep releasing material as quickly as possible. Alas, this resulted 
in... just one EP: [Summer 2019: Extended Play in 2019](/summer-2019-ep). As fate would have it, 
COVID made our plan impossible. In order to keep writing, we met over Zoom over a number
of cocktails and hatched a plan to continue writing and recording via sharing videos.
This culminated in 3 songs that we released on YouTube and dubbed The Isolation Series:
[Just Let it Pass](https://youtu.be/P_5gNopfRT4), [Single Lens Reflex](https://youtu.be/IEitz9cUWHQ), 
and [Unwind](https://youtu.be/Rb434w3SCnA). Audio versions were released via Bandcamp
to benefit Black Lives Matter and Campaign Zero.  

While we were in part realizing our vision of releasing material in smaller
amounts more quickly, we found ourselves missing the holistic consideration and
planning that comes with a full-length release. How an entire album is paced,
the story it tells, the vinyl vs streaming track list consideration, the videos,
etc that come with a larger trove of material. When we could finally get
together in person, around 2021 or so, we decided to combine the material that
we had been working on that we had not released since Jumping the Tracks, with
new material to create this latest release: **Further Afield**.

Further Afield was recorded entirely at our studio in Brooklyn with one notable
exception. Feeling the pressure of trying to release more material quickly, we
went to a friend's beautiful house in Saratoga Springs, NY for a week in the
fall of 2022 to complete the recording for the album. After that successful
trip, We came back to Brooklyn and put the finishing touches on the album's
songs. To give it a different twise, we outsourced the mixing for the first time ever. 
We chose to work with Ray Ketchem at [Magic Door Recording](https://www.magicdoorrecording.com/)
and we are sure are glad we did. With the album completed, we asked our old friend and
mentor Mark Robinson at [Teen-Beat Graphica](https://mmarkk.com/) to design the album, as he has all of
our other releases, and we love the results (again).

Further Afield will be released on Ernest Jenning Record Co and will be available on all
the streaming platforms, Bandcamp, and vinyl. You can pre-order the vinyl
[here](https://ernestjenning.limitedrun.com/products/778312).  It will also be available on CD
with the songs from our EP, [Summer 2019: Extended Play](/summer-2019-ep/) included as a
bonus.  

It's nice to be back.  Talk soon.
