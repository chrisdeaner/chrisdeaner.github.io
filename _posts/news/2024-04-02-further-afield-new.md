We have some exciting new to share! On May 31st, 2024 our latest full-length
release will be available. Further Afield is our first LP in a decade. It
contains many of the hallmarks of +/- {plus/minus} album, but we like to think
that this release is unique in it's more light hearted, almost dancy approach.

We are excited to announce the release of our latest full-length effort:
[Further Afield](/further-afield/), available May 31 2024.

Itâ€™s been a while since our last full-length release,
[Jumping the Tracks](/jumping-the-tracks/). That is in part because after
releasing that album we decided to release material in smaller chunks; taking
advantage of the ubiquity of streaming platforms and the ease of distribution.
This resulted in our release of
[Summer 2019: Extended Play in 2019](/summer-2019-ep). Shortly after that, we
found ourselves isolated in our homes, along with everyone else, as we weathered
the storm of the novel coronavirus. During that time, we kept writing and
releasing a series of songs on YouTube (The Isolation Series:
[Just Let it Pass](https://youtu.be/P_5gNopfRT4),
[Unwind](https://youtu.be/Rb434w3SCnA),
[Single Lens Reflex](https://youtu.be/IEitz9cUWHQ)) and made them available for
purchase on Bandcamp on Juneteenth for a limited time, with proceeds going to
the NAACP.

While we were in part realizing our vision of releasing material in smaller
amounts more quickly, we found ourselves missing the holistic consideration and
planning that comes with a full-length release. How an entire album is paced,
the story it tells, the vinyl vs streaming track list consideration, the videos,
etc that come with a larger trove of material. When we could finally get
together in person, around 2021 or so, we decided to combine the material that
we had been working on that we had not released since Jumping the Tracks, with
new material to create this latest release: **Further Afield**.

Further Afield was recorded entirely at our studio in Brooklyn with one notable
exception. Feeling the pressure of trying to release more material quickly, we
went to a friend's beautiful house in Saratoga Springs, NY for a week in the
fall of 2022 to complete the recording for the album. After that successful
trip, We came back to Brooklyn and put the finishing touches on the album's
songs. On a +/- {plus/minus} first, we outsourced the mixing. We chose to work
with Ray Ketchem at [Magic Door Recording](https://www.magicdoorrecording.com/)
and we are glad we did. With the album completed, we asked Mark Robinson at
[Teen-Beat Graphica](https://mmarkk.com/) to design the album as he has all of
our other releases, and love the results (again).

Further Afield will be released on Ernest Jenning Record Co and available on all
the streaming platforms, Bandcamp, and vinyl. You can pre-order the vinyl
