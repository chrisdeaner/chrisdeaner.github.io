We’re quite happy with the way this one turned out because it almost didn’t.

The story of how the song came to be goes like this...

<!--more-->

Patrick sketched out the intro/outro guitar lead and chord progression using
what was at the time a new app called Acapella which was/is(?) essentially a
video based four-track recorder for your phone. The guitar lead melody has a
sort of natural and effortless quality to it which we wanted to preserve and
maintain for the whole song. Because of that, it took some time for the complete
composition to take shape. In its early form it went through several iterations
that we were dissatisfied with. They were much mellower and Chris had an
entirely different drum beat. Patrick also demoed several acoustic versions at
home on Voice Memo, chiseling away at it by trying different chord progressions
and vocal melodies, but again found them all ineffective. Because sometimes the
best way to keep a song natural is not to force it, we shelved it.

A few years later we were messing around on guitars and drums in the studio and
happened upon a chord progression that because of its similar major minor
feeling key, thought it might slot in well with the original piece. It worked
and in marrying the two parts, the verse of the song became clear, and the rest
of composition seemd to come together relatively quickly. But then Covid hit so
it wouldn’t see the light of day for another 5 years. Well 8 years if you’re
counting.

The track also features Patrick’s daughter’s former high school treble chorus.
He had shared a video of a beautiful performance of theirs and James suggested
that it would go well on the song. He sampled it, chopped it up and after
pitch-shifting and other audio wizardry, added it to the chorus. Despite being
unrecognizable from the original, Patrick likes the idea of, in theory, singing
together with his daughter on the recording.

For the video, we had been kicking around the idea of capturing us in a live-ish
setting for a while. We wanted it to be as natural as possible, and the obvious
setting was our rehearsal studio. By shooting it in the studio, we could use the
video idea for almost any song and we could shoot it while rehearsing for a live
show. A twofer! But… we didn’t know what song to apply it to. As we looked
through the track list on Further Afield, it was clear that the most exciting
choice from a visual performance perspective was _Calling Off the Rescue_. We
bought a couple smartphone mounts and pressed record while we worked through the
song. We think the energy and enjoyment of playing this piece translates well in
the video. Hope you do too!

We also made a YouTube Short about this. Enjoy!
