#### Lyrics

#### Young Once

How can you not see you're gone?  
Like all the dead leaves when fall comes  
Why should you believe me now?  
When you're running in circles crusading and fleeing love

You were the young once  
Love devotees on trampolines

You're coming on denouement  
Nothing but deceit in your heart  
You'll be sadly the slated as no hope from C.P.R.  
Sadly the slated as no hope from C.P.R.

But you were the young once  
Love devotees on trampolines

#### The Bitterest Pill

Swallowed down  
The bitterest pill around,  
Dissolving into the veins and the heart can’t be rid of it now,  
And it does no good  
Even when it’s understood,  
It will remain and there isn’t a way to get it all out

Every single breath  
Making you more upset,  
Shutting it down is the way that you’ve found to prolong this slow death,  
And it does no good  
Even when it’s understood,  
It still remains and there isn’t a way to get it all out,

Footprints we left in the sand  
They just faded away too soon,  
Don’t know if you ever think about it  
But it’s all I do.

Time grows long  
Somehow you don’t move on,  
Cold is the comfort of knowing exactly what’s going wrong,  
And it does no good  
Even when it’s understood,  
Always the same you can’t think of a way to get it all out,

All of the things that we had  
They just faded away too soon,  
Don’t’ know if you ever think about it  
But it’s all I do.  
Resigned to defeat,  
So we’re doomed to repeat,  
What we’re going through,  
Don’t know if you ever think about it  
But it’s

All the venom that is spit off-handedly,  
A poison seeping slowly into the heart,  
And it’s overwhelming everything around us,  
Sets the teeth on edge as it slowly tears us apart,

I thought you should know.

All of the things that we had  
They just faded away too soon,  
Don’t’ know if you ever think about it  
But it’s all I do.  
We’re always stuck in the same old story, We don’t pull through.  
Don’t’ know if you ever think about it  
But it’s all I do.

#### Toe the Line

You never sway in the windy night  
You never sink in the rolling tide  
But now you’re drowning alone again,  
Uncomfortable in your own skin

So you put it under lock and key  
Using silence so accusingly  
And you’re lying in a separate bed,  
With insomnia instead of me,

(All you say that you want.)

Here we are after all these days,  
And it’s life that we while away,  
(All you say that you want.)  
Just a glance when we pass in the hall,  
We never break through the silence at all,  
(Have you got everything you want?)

And now it’s normal so there’s nothing to do,  
Just gotta try hard to make it through  
(All you say that you want.)  
And I’m lying in a separate bed,  
With insomnia instead of you,  
(Is it all you need?)

What do you do when it fades to nothing?  
You’re getting sore from sitting tight.  
Do you wait for another connection?  
It starts to kill you just to toe the line.  
It’s gonna kill you just to toe the line.

#### The Space Between Us

We knock on doors,  
When no one’s home,  
No cars and the yard is overgrown,

So we break in,  
Out of the cold,  
Desperate for warmth in the unknown,

And all those times rushing by,  
From here to infinity,

Swept out into the night,  
And they never come back again,

Take up arms choose your sides,  
We had this feeling years ago,

No way across the divide,  
It’s only space between us now.

And now it’s gone,  
Away from here,  
Lost and found, in faded years.

#### What Lies Ahead

She floats away now  
She's down to bed  
Wish I could keep you  
From the lies ahead

Just mind your head  
Please don't forget  
To shine light ahead  
On the lies ahead

What lies ahead  
What lies ahead  
The lies ahead  
Use light instead

#### Exorcising Your Ghost

In the night listening to you exhale,  
Lying beside you satisfied,

It’s a dream  
I’m trapped and there's no way out,  
Lost within endless doubt,  
So lost,

And there’s no point to get out,  
Nothing gained, going without,  
And I’m still waiting for the day when  
I wake up and I’m living.

Yeah I know,  
That’s what kills me the most:  
Exorcising your ghost for good

And there’s no point to set out,  
Nothing gained, going without,  
And I’m still waiting for the day when  
I wake up and I’m living.

And so what does it get you  
When you take away everything and you’re left alone?

Would it kill you  
If you were to make believe that you could still feel love?

Would it upset you?  
If I take away everything and it’s set in stone?

Would it kill you?  
If you were to make believe that you could still be loved?

#### Rewrite the Story

So far,  
Gliding along without intention,

Long gone,  
Blown by the breeze,  
Fields will lie fallow

Oh you don’t pay attention,  
That’s how you end up beat down,  
Sands slipping through,  
Waiting forever,

Don’t mind years passing by No time to notice

And find You don’t know how to rewrite the story

Oh you don’t pay attention,  
That’s how you end up beat down,

Floating away in space,  
No longer out of place,  
No longer feel the pull,  
Vanish without a trace,

And now it’s set ablaze,  
Nothing to hold you,

Downwind,  
The first place you land won’t be the last one

Oh you don’t pay attention  
To what you commit to,  
Tied down,  
Frozen by fear,  
Waiting forever.

There Goes My Love

Hate comes after denial  
And slowly eats into your head  
And you lose blood in your veins  
You're running out of love

It's so long and you're done  
It's so long now you've gone  
Right back out in two

There goes my love  
You know it couldn't wait  
Take everything when you leave now Broken by love I know you couldn't wait  
Make believe it's ok now

I hate I fell for you  
I doubt you ever knew  
That I could feel  
Up and down your spine  
When all of your measured love withdrew

It's so long and you're done  
It's so long now you've gone  
Right back out in two

There goes my love  
You know it couldn't wait  
Take everything when you leave now Broken by love I know you couldn't wait  
Make believe it's ok now

Yeah it's a light  
A light inside the walls surrounding you

#### Running the Distance

Looking afield for reasons to let go,  
Alone at the wheel,  
Distance yourself from me,

Caught in the breeze, a kite in a tree,  
Unable to leave,  
Tangled up all the while,

All the stars are gone,  
You waited all night long but you don’t see anything

Running the distance,  
I’m never able to keep stride,

Left it for dead,  
Buried at sea,  
Spiraling down,  
A ship run aground in the tide,

Caught in the breeze,  
A kite in a tree,  
Unable to leave,  
Tangled up all the while,

All the stars are gone,  
You waited all night long but you don’t see anything, That’s no lazy eye,  
Looking for the reasons why we lost everything

Running the distance  
I’m never able to keep stride.

#### No one can touch you now

Running through your disappearing act,  
Somehow I feel I have to persist,  
In bringing all the history back,  
You make sure I no longer exist,

Where’d you go to?  
No one can touch you now.

Silence is the natural refrain,  
It’s the only possible response,  
Frozen from that ice in your veins,  
That you refuse to ever let defrost,

Where’d you go to?  
No one can touch you now.

All you withdrew,  
All you don’t have now.

#### Jumping the Tracks

Hey,  
Should we take a holiday  
From being blown away?  
Cuz it’s always too late to start,  
When you feel you’ll be torn apart,  
Yeah you know we’ll be torn apart,

So we stand our ground and wait,  
For the apathy to take,  
One more day to feel less alive,  
Statuesque and crumbling inside,  
Yeah you know so gone all the while,

Hey,  
Gonna hide that heart away,  
(all the way to the end)  
Cuz we need that holiday,  
Don’t you feel we’re not coming back?  
(all the way to the end)  
Once we’re gone there’s no coming back,  
Yeah you know we’re jumping the tracks.

We’re colliding yet we’re splitting in two,  
But we’re so numb we don’t feel what to do,  
No way to keep us on.

Wait,  
Don’t you take that all away,  
Like you’ll never be OK,  
Cuz it’s too late to get it back,  
Once we’re gone there’s no coming back,  
Oh you know we’re jumping the tracks.

We’re colliding yet we’re splitting in two,  
But we’re so numb we don’t feel what to do,  
No way to keep us on,  
And we’re slowly fading into the blue,  
But we’re so numb we don’t feel what to do,  
No way to keep us on.

#### I'm A Little Teapot (Bonus)

Lately I've been a cauldron  
You should leave when all of the steam builds  
And my lid goes flying off When it rains down on us

Laying under shady tree  
Should calm your frayed nerves  
But it creeps into each of your veins  
And all of your blood begins to boil

Then it's raining on us  
Boiling rain down on us  
Acrid rain on us  
Leaves a stain on us

Lately I've been a cauldron  
Slowing stewing on low
