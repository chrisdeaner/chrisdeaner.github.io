## Lyrics

<h3 id="self-titled-long-playing-debut-album">Self Titled Long Playing Debut Album</h3>

#### All I do

All I do  
Is think about you.

#### Crestfallen

Ooh ooh ooh ooh.

#### The Queen of Detroit

All of a sudden I am flying in a plane  
I Beeline to michigan when new york is insane  
I realign my head because there's nothing else to do  
I drink coffee to divine why I am so confused

And then I found myself walking with the queen of detroit  
An audience with someone whose life I have not destroyed

You're dealing with a kid that doesn't have a clue  
That chasing you around is not the thing to do

And then I found myself walking with the queen of detroit  
An audience with someone whose life I have not destroyed  
But give me time and I can mess up anything at all  
And I'll be fine after I take advantage of your fall.

#### Beverley Road

There's something I left back there at beverley road  
There's something I missed, sometimes it's just hard to know  
If anything's left you can assume it's not mine  
There's just one more thing I don't want to leave behind

Please don't let me throw everything away  
The salvation army doesn't bring anything back again

You want to remove every trace I had been  
I'll have one more look before your new life moves on in  
If anything's left you can assume it's not mine  
There's just one more thing… something I see in your eye

Please don't let me throw everything away  
The salvation army doesn't bring anything back again  
To you.

#### Manifest Destiny (in general)

I know I said the wrong things to you  
And I wish could say I meant to  
I wish that I could think of all those  
Right things to do but I just don't

But I know that I was a fool  
And you deserve someone new

I know I said the wrong things to you, dear.

#### The Declaration of Independence

After all the pain is done  
She reaches into her nightgown  
She curls herself into a ball

She sleeps forever like a bear  
Because she knows there's no one there  
To hurry her into the shower again

And you know she's gonna be alright

She's on the phone with all her friends  
The conversation never ends  
She's got the stories people love to hear  
And you know she's gonna be alright

Cleaning up the house today  
She runs across some of his old things  
She realizes why it never worked

And you know she's gonna be just fine  
And you know she's gonna be alright  
And you know she's gonna be just fine  
And you know she's alright.

#### Setting Your Head on Fire

Halo : everyone you want to know  
Solo : everywhere you want to go

Setting your head on fire's alright  
Hope you can put it out in

Time for quality control intake valve or  
Filter for the lesser need  
System failure in the first degree :  
Kissed them - makeshift and economy

Setting your head on fire's alright  
Hope you can put it out in time  
Hop on a plane and take a ride  
Globally locally inside.

#### The Industrial Revolution

In my kitchen sink  
All I had to drink  
Bottles empty  
And things I never had In the living room  
All I have to do  
Television's fine  
If you've got the time

If everything around me was indication of me  
You'd see nothing here  
Just and empty clear head

In my kitchen sink  
All I had to drink  
Bottles empty  
And things I never had

In my double bed  
You walk around my head  
It's not very cold  
Unless you wake up alone

If everything around me was indication of me  
You'd see nothing here  
Just and empty clear head.

#### Yo Yo Yo (please don't fall in love)

One night stands and cheap perfume  
Cosmopolitans and smoky rooms  
Don't fall in love with anyone too soon

They've got ideas of what they want you to do  
Everything gained and nothing to lose  
Don't fall in love with anyone too soon

Please don't fall in love.

#### I Sleep Forever

Hey there don't you know?  
I Sleep Forever  
And my endeavors don't pan out at all  
I think you should know just you're in for

I won't ever be  
The things you want from me  
I can try but I know better

In some perfect world  
Things could be different and I could change it  
Save yourself some grief  
You ought to know just what you're in for

I won't ever be  
The things you want from me  
I can try but I know better  
I won't ever be  
The things you want from me  
It's not my self esteem  
It's you…

#### Ill Advised

See how it feels  
When it's all torn adunder  
You think I'm stealing thunder  
Anxiety  
All of these things upset you  
What does it really get you?  
Do what you need

To make your time all fall back in line  
Ill advised  
To waste your time wandering around  
Ill advised  
And you know…

And in the end  
There are no guilty pleasures  
Walking without a thether  
You know it's true

To waste your time wandering around  
Ill advised  
To make your time all fall back in line  
Ill advised.

#### The Separation of Church and State

Hey, don't write me off just yet  
I could still be everything that you said  
Hey, don't hang out to dry  
I could be superhero material  
Secret identity is optional

And how I know is I have such big ideas about my life  
And where it's going  
But that's not really knowing to you

Hey, don't throw me out to sea  
I'm not so good at swimming so nakedly  
Without a life preserver, I'll surely sink  
Hey, I've got some good years left  
I hope someday you'll truly understand  
I could still be everything that you said.

#### All I Ever Knew

Time can stand still inside my funeral home  
And the things I do, not set in stone  
Oh the bright ideas  
In the dark when you feel oh so cold

Breathing in fumes  
Embalming while I sew  
And her skin looks so pretty down below  
Oh the bright ideas  
In the dark when you feel oh so cold

Oh I tried to fight  
The pull those awful nights  
All I ever knew  
Don't regret the things I do  
So close your eyes tonight  
Everything will work out fine  
Yeah, it'll work out fine

We've only got this one moment in time  
I'll let the fluids bring you back to life  
Because tonight you're mine  
And I'll shut your eyes

The stiffness of the skin  
Will stretch with the mood I'm in  
All I ever knew  
Don't regret the things I do  
So close your eyes tonight  
Everything will work out fine

It'll work out fine

It's all I ever knew  
It's all I ever knew  
I don't regret the things I do  
It's all I ever knew.

#### Pencil Me In

Ooh ooh ooh ooh pencil me in

Sometime between Sunday and Saturday  
Morning or evening  
there must be an open appointment you haven't made

Why can't you pencil me in  
hey babe, pencil me in

Has it occurred to you that I am nothing more  
than an appointment you don't want keep  
am I no longer in with your filofax courtesy?

Hey babe, pencil me in  
Oh no, pencil me in Come on…

#### It's Not What You Think

Two years ago  
I lost my home  
Stuck down in a hole  
Too far from home

I knew you would leave  
How could I blame?  
It's not what you think  
I won't complain

Forward march  
I've got my home  
It's easy.

#### A Million Pieces on the Ground

At the bottom of your ocean  
In the midst the commotion  
I was diving in your sea  
With a knife in between my teeth

In a barrel over the falls  
It occured to me why you jumped  
You're better off where you are  
Seems my paddle was your arm

Now I'm sailing through the air  
No one has to trust me here  
Nothing is a could have been  
Nowhere safe for me to land  
Now I'm floating back to earth  
Hurtling on my return  
When my body touches down  
A million pieces on the ground.

<h3 id="holding-patterns-album">Holding Patterns</h3>

#### I've Been Lost

All of the things that I had planned  
On the back burner  
Not in hand  
If it all fell apart today  
What would I have to show for it?

Back in the foreground don't you see?  
Dressed like a stone and constantly  
Everything's coming back to me  
Everything's set for me to be.

Try to understand  
I've been lost

Ending, beginning  
What's the use?  
It doesn't matter which came first  
Standing up straight was never right  
Kneeling upright is even worse

Try to understand  
I've been lost  
Not the only one  
Ready to come down.

#### Trapped Under Ice Floes

So stuck inside  
No bars are on the windows  
try to stem the tide  
it's more than you can swallow

Ice coursing through the veins now  
through the arteries  
cold from the neck down  
your fingers frozen  
is that it for you?

Trapped under ice floes  
Swimming toward the exit  
Up from the cold  
So numb you barely felt it

Ice coursing through the veins now  
through the arteries  
cold from the neck down  
your fingers frozen  
is that it for you?  
All you can do to stop it  
Is sink down  
and hope that you don't drown  
take a deep breath  
and dive right into it

yeah you're coming down.

#### Far into the Fields

Day breaking  
You're back into my arms  
Arms holding  
Patterns straight cross your sky  
Say only the words  
Then I will run  
Far into the fields  
And back by your side

Are you there too?

Stay just for a night  
And then you go home  
Wait for me for years  
And then I'll come home

Are you there too?

#### You've Just Got It All

Although you are so tongue tied  
Everything seems to go right  
You can never fall  
It's never a question of time  
Everything comes around right  
You've just got it all

Somebody get a snapshot  
A balancing act means a lot  
As long as you can fall  
Cocktails and shots seem so right  
They give so much meaning to life  
You've just got it all

(you feel able, you feel stable, you feel alright)

Somebody call the m.d.  
seems like a case of hiding everything that's wrong  
can you envision the time  
everything will be alright  
you'll just have it all

on your own  
you get that chill and you pick up the phone  
you make a call and you hop on the train  
small price to pay to ignore all the pain

you can never fall, you've just got it all

on your own  
you get that chill and you pick up the phone  
you make a call and you hop on the train  
small price to pay  
doesn't deal with the pain

you can never fall, you've just got it all.

#### Making the Horse Drink

pack your bags  
and meet me on a plane that leaves today  
waiting for a heart attack  
is no reason for you to stay  
a still life on your bedroom floor  
stripped down to the bone

I'm not dead

So shoot me, I'm no longer scared  
Take me out, I'm no longer scared

Timer's on and going down  
You need to leave a trace  
A seagull in a parking lot  
Too easy to displace  
Arms around the state you're in  
It's the last night of the world

I'm not dead

So shoot me, I'm no longer scared  
Take me out, I'm no longer scared

Waiting on you  
You say it kills you too  
Hollow yourself  
Please save what you have left  
This face on you  
Listless as you're wont to  
Choking on fumes  
The sun in an empty room.

<h3 id="you-are-here-album">You are Here</h3>

#### If I Am Charming

Hey there honey pie  
I'm begging, baby, please  
For you to notice me  
And be free of disease

If I am charming  
Will you take me home tonight?  
I promise that I'll leave  
Before you turn out the light I look to you  
To validate my life  
You are the cutest thing  
in THIS bar tonight

How many drinks will I have to buy  
to figure out I'm not that kind of guy?

Do you ever feel  
like you're life is dictated by impossible ideals?  
Do you ever find  
You left the important things behind?

#### Ventriloquist

I am riding in a car  
please don’t take me back there  
don’t want the drive to end

I am riding in a car  
please don’t take this exit  
and please don’t drop me just yet

there’s a crash up ahead  
keep your eyes open  
gonna get in your head  
gonna get in yours  
these ventriloquists.

#### Surprise!

You hold your hands inside  
attached to the hooks and lines  
that make the fear subside  
but no matter how hard you try  
you’re always made of stone  
and there will be nothing wrong  
yes then you will have it all  
until it’s all that you own

oh you’ve got a surprise waiting for you

one day won’t you find  
it didn’t just pass with time?  
instead there’s a whole lot more  
of what you’ve been hiding from  
you aim your eyes ahead  
staring a thousand yards  
you don’t see everything  
isn’t really all that far

oh you’ve got a surprise waiting for you.

#### She’s got your eyes

Yo yo yo don’t you know?  
I’m alive with your child  
that you won’t see  
but she’s still real  
now I’ve come back to see you

I’ll find out where you live  
and surprise the wife and kids  
you owe me something real  
because you’ll find  
she’s got your eyes

come on now  
you know how this came up  
now you’re stuck  
think of me and where I’ll be  
I’ve got ways to make you pay

I’ll find out where you live  
and surprise the wife and kids  
you owe me something real  
because you’ll find  
she’s got your eyes.

#### Summer Dress 1 (All her winter

clothes)

In the morning before he wakes up  
she’s collecting her clothes around the bed,  
walking tiptoes and fixing her hair  
shuts the door and she runs down the stairs

in a summer dress she walks on home  
all her winter clothes are gone or sold

there’s no looking back and there’s no fear  
there’s no reason for her to believe  
that she needs to hang on to her past  
it’s so natural just to move on  
and he doesn’t know that she’s really

gone into her closet and her drawers  
to throw out the things she can’t ignore  
in a summer dress she walks on home  
all her winter clothes are gone or sold.

#### Cutting out

I called you on the phone,  
you’re cutting out  
I can still hear you,  
but you’re cutting out  
I’m still hanging on  
while you’re cutting out  
I think you’re breaking up

I didn’t realize what you had said  
I only thought the line was going dead

I thought I heard you wrong  
you were cutting out  
now I know just why  
you were cutting out  
I tried to call you back  
you were cutting out  
but you’re already gone

I didn’t realize what you had said  
I only thought the line was going dead  
everything has already been said  
I only thought the line was going dead.

#### Megalomaniac

Save me I’m down  
My story ends  
Before it begins  
And maybe  
When all my sense is gone  
I’ll come before you  
And so long  
Cause I can’t keep my head  
From all my stupid musing  
Cause any way you turn  
There’s someone out for more  
If I just take these things with me she will

Breathe and sing along  
Should I?

What’s so wrong  
With calling for his head  
Save for sounding lazy?  
Cause any way you turn  
There’s someone out for more  
If I just take these things with me she will

Breathe and sing along  
Should I?

#### Scarecrow

Get that girl on the phone  
if you think she’s all alone  
you’re right this time  
and every time

get that surgeon on the line  
the stitches fade away with time  
the suture’s closed  
no one will ever know

she seemed so strong with no fears at all  
how come no one ever gets through?

scarecrow standing in a field  
no one within miles to see  
the distance grows  
the fire goes cold

now I’m gone  
the moment’s gone.

#### No one sees you like I do

Car parked out in the driveway  
I’m here to pay a visit  
now I know that you’re alone  
I see you in the window  
talking with someone on the phone  
you’re still in your night clothes

following you to the bedroom  
next in your morning schedule  
you begin to brush your hair  
I love every movement  
no one sees you like I do now  
nobody ever will

hands tied onto the bedpost  
tears falling down from the blindfold  
running my hands through your hair  
hush now – you won’t feel a thing.

#### Here we are (again)

Your razor’s on my shelf  
a toothbrush by the sink  
it’s silly don’t you think  
that half of your clothes are here

here you are again with fatalistic view  
what are we gonna do?  
it’s been so many years…

aren’t you gonna say that you’re taking me away?  
instead of waiting every day  
paralyzed by fear

in the meantime while you concentrate on you  
that’s what you’ve got to do  
but don’t ask me for time

oh we’re running out of room now  
you take that solo attitude  
oh what are we gonna do now?  
don’t take that solo attitude

I gotta say it seems you’re pushing me away  
I thought you wanted it this way  
well I did  
now I want more

for the last time just tell me yes or no  
and then finally I’ll know  
but don’t ask me for time

oh we’re running out of room now  
you take that solo attitude  
oh what are we gonna do now?  
don’t take that solo attitude

I want to see you aiming for the things  
the things I want too  
I want to see you think of me for real  
is that so hard to do?

oh we’re running out of room now  
you take that solo attitude  
oh what are we gonna do now?  
don’t take that solo attitude

you take that solo attitude -  
don’t take that solo attitude.

#### Everything I see makes it feel wrong

Now the ground is clear of snow  
the bees buzzing around the rose  
and the clouds all in a row  
but you’re still gone

and the ice is off the trees  
the sun is shining through the leaves  
but the only thing I see  
is that you’re gone

and everything I see makes it feel wrong

and I think I’m sinking fast  
to the bottom of a glass  
and I know I’ll lose my mind  
it’s the only thing that lets me forget  
that you’re gone

and sometimes it’s hard to breathe  
when I shut my eyes I see  
all the things I should have seen  
had I known

and now everything I see makes it feel wrong

and I think I’m sinking fast  
to the bottom of a glass  
and I know I’ll lose my mind  
it’s the only thing that lets me forget  
that you’ve gone

and I know I’m sinking fast  
to the bottom of a glass  
it’s the only thing I can find  
that can put you out of mind  
now that you’ve gone.

#### Walk in a Straight Line

In a peculair way  
I think I might stay  
attached to you  
When I come around  
I won’t make a sound  
for you

all my ideas  
are premised on the truth  
that it was you  
who loved me

I’ll walk in a straight line  
and so you might find  
it’s really true  
if I steal away  
then I’ll hear you say  
all I need

all my ideas  
are premised on the truth  
that it was you  
who loved me.

#### Chromatic

Picket fences, children in the yard  
double barrel shotgun in the hall  
hiding behind gates and urban sprawl  
20 miles north of anyone who can do us harm

supermarket cafeterias  
one hour photo portraits at the mall

are you safe? well yes!  
you’ve still got a gun  
ain’t it simple?  
paint by numbers  
what could ever go wrong

follow in the path of your old man  
family business needs a family man

are you safe? well yes!  
you’ve still got a gun  
ain’t it simple?  
paint by numbers  
what could ever go wrong?

<h3 id="lets-build-a-fire-album">Let’s Build a Fire</h3>

#### Let’s Build a Fire

Maybe it’s better if I stop focusing  
on all of the problems that reignite the fear  
So this is the last time you’ll see me disappear  
I won’t be withdrawing from

attempts to look within  
don’t know where to begin  
‘cause I put up the walls  
and shut myself again

All of this has got to go

So let’s build a fire to burn away the past  
Don’t be sentimental  
our time is fading fast  
Roll out the bulldozers  
to raze the structures that  
keep us sheltered from the honest

attempts to look within  
don’t know where to begin  
‘cause I put up the walls  
and shut myself again

All of this has got to go

So bring the house down  
and let’s begin again.

#### Fadeout

Take no solace in my sense of what to do  
My eyes are closed  
and I’ve got no blindfold  
Still I’m driving you home

Take the time you will see  
everybody knows what’s been going on

Mainline  
Fadeout  
Heartache  
don’t know what to do  
I look for something more  
A bad taste  
Still I’m driving you home

Take the time you will see  
everybody knows what’s been going on  
No heartache  
Figure out what’s the deal  
Everybody knows what is going on

Break out  
Do it now  
Don’t wait for a sense of what to do  
You never know unless you do  
No blindfold  
Still I’m driving you home

Take the time you will see  
everybody knows what’s been going on  
No heartache  
Figure out what’s the deal  
Everybody knows what is going on

#### Steal the Blueprints

Hey  
I never thought I’d find  
under layers of regret  
a recognition of the time  
before the boundaries were set  
when the pages were left blank  
the gold still buried in the soil  
and you could make a lot of noise  
with no connection to the past

Do you wonder just what happened to  
all the desire to carry on  
without knowing where you’re going?

Now it’s flavor of the month  
with all the expectations met  
Before they strike a single chord  
you can predict what you will get

Hey  
Steal the blueprints and the maps  
stamp the spade into the ground  
strip the gold under the soil  
then stake a claim to the sound.

Do you wonder just what happened to  
all the desire to carry on  
without knowing where you’re going?

#### The Important Thing is to Love

Hey I am shutting down  
Think they got me good  
When they lulled me to sleep  
Never mind that I sow and they reap

But hey I can wipe it all  
Erase everything  
Just by holding delete  
Till I find something good

Hey I’ve become undone  
I misunderstood  
Talk like I’m on TV  
Where’s my mind?&nbsp; Heaven knows who I’ve been

So hey I’ll be coming down  
Hard on everything  
I‘ve been led to believe  
Hope I find something good

I used to be so full of love  
The important thing is to love.

#### Summer Dress 2 (Iodine)

She’s telling herself  
“He won’t be the same as when I left him”  
The ring’s still on the shelf  
“I know that he’s learned just how to treat me”

“Iodine  
treats me fine  
cleans away  
the memories of all the times I wanted to leave”

Blue summer dress  
ribbons in her hair ‘cause that’s his favorite  
he said he was wrong  
it’s so hard for him to say he’s sorry

“Iodine  
treats me fine  
cleans away  
the memories of all the times I wanted to leave”  
“He won’t be the same as when I left him”  
“I know that he’s learned just how to treat me”

“Iodine  
treats me fine  
cleans away  
the memories

And one day, I’ll throw the bottle away.”

#### Ignoring All the Detours

It feels like looking in from the outside  
and if you squint right, things look like they’re alright  
but oh how wrong we were  
we never thought it could get worse

And I tried to look ahead  
I would have followed you anywhere anyway  
blind to the signs  
And oh I guess should have known  
I got caught ignoring all the detours  
that were holding us back (and forth)

And sometimes you get the instant reply  
and all the while you miss the real meaning  
but oh how wrong we were  
we never saw it getting worse.

#### Profession

I must profess  
That I cannot acquiesce  
‘Cause when I lay me down to sleep  
My soul is mine to keep

But you won’t have me  
Hell is where I’ll be  
Alone  
Alone  
You’re onto me

Won’t you please condone?  
Without you I can atone  
And if I die before I wake  
My soul’s not yours to take

And you won’t have me  
Hell is where I’ll be  
Oh no  
Oh no  
I’m onto you.

#### One Day You’ll Be There

You’re sailing through the air to nowhere  
the trajectory unclear  
but it feels like it’s somewhere  
don’t really care if you land or you fall  
because it’s not up to you  
don’t you know that it should be?

Sign on the dotted line for an unlimited time  
but you still won’t know

You feel a hundred feet tall  
you see all the things that you could do  
but they’re not what you’re doing  
Everyone knows where you stand  
but you can never see it for yourself  
Don’t you know that you should be?

Sign on the dotted line for an unlimited time  
but you still won’t know.

#### This is All (I Have Left)

A lipstick stain on a mug  
a novel that was barely read  
those dresses hanging in the hall  
and letters filling my dresser drawer

This is all I have left

A message on the telephone  
an empty seat in the car  
a loss for any words to speak  
the pain that’s flooding into the heart

This is all I have left

Your ring is shining in my eyes  
a mute reminder of your hand  
holding onto the last thread  
of all the things we never said

All those years to lament  
all those times to forget  
This is all I have left.

#### Leap Year

She says, “Here is someday. We’ll find some way.”  
Nothing’s put upon me

Search lights, helicopters  
Sound the all clear  
Someone’s pulling me in

She smiles and I leave my feet  
She tries to bring the world out of sleep

All my indecision  
Lacking vision  
She holds a skeleton key

Leap year in our own way  
Armistice Day  
She is everything

She smiles and I leave my feet  
She tries to bring the world out of sleep

Everything  
She said, “Here is someday. We’ll find some way.”  
And pulled me in.

#### Time and Space

There’s something to be said for waiting  
despite the knowledge it’ll never come  
In the face of doubt  
learn to go without  
and within

And there’s something to be said for action  
to see the consequences get played out  
In the end you find  
you’ve run out of time and space in your heart

OK  
Alright  
You’re OK  
but it’s not fine

And now you’re coming round the corner again  
and you’re leaving everything behind  
Out of sight  
out of mind  
You’ve run out of time and space in your heart

OK  
Alright  
You’re OK  
but it’s not fine

Where did you go to?  
Nothing left to hold onto  
Can you just close up?  
Can you just give up?

#### For You

Sunlight in the hall  
Slips between the cracks in the floorboards  
Where I’ve settled in  
Buried deep in your torrent of memories flooding in

So now you give up  
Watch you sink into some great oblivion  
No hands on the wheel  
Lights off and the static of a.m. coming in

You don’t want to be  
Somewhere in between  
Before you begin to fall into  
Some silly suicide play  
Throwing all of it away

Sunlight in the hall  
Slips between the cracks in the floorboards  
Where I’ve settled in  
Buried deep in your torrent of memories flooding in

#### Camouflage Fades into Trust

If you were still here  
we’d fade into one  
and the camouflage would fade into trust  
and there’d be no more wanderlust

If I could have known  
what’s obvious now  
all my regrets would erase the doubts  
It’d all come down to here and now  
and nothing more

The final scene fades to black  
Apologies only lack  
and you won’t see it crumble to dust  
as the camouflage fades into trust

At the end of the day  
the sun disappears  
shadows grow long and fade into fear  
and I’ll be in the dark again  
and nothing more

The final scene fades to black  
Apologies only lack  
and you won’t see it crumble to dust  
as the camouflage fades into trust.

#### Forward March

(instrumental)

#### Hellkite

Waiting for a sign that you’re not really  
Supposed to wake up  
Find we’ve been dreaming  
All of this time

Anti-depressant ads list all your symptoms  
But claim to not know what makes you feel them  
Though it’s rather sad  
You have to laugh

It’s so hard to reach you  
As subtle as a tele-preacher  
In a whore house  
Just thought you should know

It’s clear it’s by design  
Though you’re not nearly as clever  
As time exposes these things  
You should have known

But I don’t place the blame on you  
Or your ill-fated venture to save the day

It’s so hard to reach you  
As subtle as a tele-preacher  
In a whore house  
Just thought you should know

Waiting for a sign that you’re not really  
Supposed to wake up  
Find we’ve been dreaming  
All of this time

It’s so hard to reach you  
Nothing I try ever seems to  
Just thought you should know.

<h3 id="xs-on-your-eyes-album">Xs on your Eyes</h3>

#### Tired Eyes

Spinning out of control  
Sailing off the tracks  
Knuckles white on the wheel  
Yet there’s nothing to grasp

All for the sake of tired eyes  
Ripped down the seams on the ride

Choking down the dust  
Coughing up the debris  
Arms outstretched to the sun  
All but poised to break free

All for the sake of tired eyes  
Ripped down the seams on the ride

And there’s no  
Illusion  
It’s hollowing the tree to escape  
On board the  
Delusion

All for the sake of tired eyes  
Ripped down the seams on the ride In the desert a thirst  
Dries the skin like a drum  
Though the spirit is low  
Arms outstretched to the sun

And there’s no  
Illusion  
Hollowing the tree to escape  
On board the  
Delusion  
Borrowing the arrows to break  
Open  
The doors and  
Paddling away on the wake  
You make for the shoreline and fly.

#### Snowblind

All the things that upset you  
Swirling round and round  
In your head  
It’s up  
And down

It’s enough to fill the oceans  
This uncertainty  
Expectant doubt  
You can’t reroute

And all the things that direct you  
Couldn’t find their mark  
And it seems a near miss hits you  
Harder than it feels

And all the things that get you  
Worked into frenzy  
It just seems there is no way to  
Draw the poison out.

And in the space of a lifetime  
Scratching at the walls of hidden cells  
Of where no one can  
Tell that it’s you

Taking in the delusion  
Oh what scenery the lies can make  
Never seems to  
Cause the dam to break.

All the things that upset you  
Overwhelming everything you see  
You are snow blind  
In a sand storm haze

There’s nothing to connect to  
It all descends on you  
And you are an empty frame.

With all the things that upset you  
Swirling round and round  
It seems there is no way to  
Draw the poison out.

#### Subdued

Wake up with a scream trapped in my throat again  
Call the airway team  
Take some TNT and blow up the dam in me  
Make the river punch through

Subdued

Bell-mouth spillways (to maintain integrity)  
Silence the song in you  
Flow rate: an easy stream (so fuse plugs don’t wash away)  
Slowly eroding you

Subdued

#### The Queen of Nothing

There's a pull from beneath  
Wooden floors and salty seas  
In the fields beneath the snow  
Monuments to letting go

All the gold buried down  
Deep below a dusty crown of what you sow

Drifting through across the sand  
Hands dug down beneath the earth  
Pockets full of diamonds and  
Treasures you do not deserve

All the gold buried down  
Deep below a dusty crown of what you sow

I don't mind

‘cause I won't be on my knees  
Lifting flowers to the trees  
Holding fast to the sound  
Of my heart tearing apart

There's a killer on the run  
Folding hands beneath the sun  
Come this way no don't be long  
The queen of nothing won't step down

All the gold buried down  
Deep below a dusty crown of what you sow

I don't mind

‘cause I won't be on my knees  
Lifting flowers to the trees  
Holding fast to the sound  
Of my heart tearing apart

Don't you know your reign is done  
So step down from your throne  
Queen of all became none,  
Subjects gone my heart won't be the one

#### Halos

Stay within the lines and wait  
Taking what you need no more  
Aiming for the greater good  
You know to never stray

Ooh  
You’re taking it all with you now  
You’re making a hole in the floor Take a set of wings and fly

Today a picture of remorse  
No the past is not on time  
You know you never found out

Ooh  
You’re taking it all with you now  
You’re making a hole in the floor  
You’re pounding a nail in the heart  
You bury the heart in the ground

Alright  
Seems like  
That’s all

#### Unsung

In a car  
Bathed in the sunlight  
You were going to speed away  
From the city life  
Choking down one last breath  
You turn around

Oh no  
Where did you go?  
All within your eyes

Down the road  
Pull to the shoulder  
Nothing seems right  
When there’s no  
Joy in the ride  
Choking down one last breath  
You turn around

Oh no  
Where did you go?  
Your song is unsung

Out the door  
Onto the freeway  
Comes the last idea  
Now ‘cause the moment’s gone  
On your feet  
Count to ten  
And then you bound

Oh no  
Where did you go?  
Your song is unsung.

#### The Hours You Keep

Wait to sleep  
I’ll be awake  
The hours you keep  
Give you away

Out of it all  
You could be wrong  
Stay out today  
Down to the sea

World asleep  
I’m still awake  
On my t.v.  
A blowhard disgrace

Step out from it all  
You could be wrong  
Is every heart  
Down in a heap?

After it all  
You still belong  
Day after day  
Don’t change a thing

#### Marina

Marina won't you come back around?  
Where'd you go to since I saw you last?  
Was walking up and down the isle  
‘gonna keep you when you're pulled by the tide

One foot in the sand  
The other in the sea  
Did you dive until  
You didn't have to breathe?  
Lost beneath the waves  
Where I can't call your name  
I'm washed up on the beach

One foot in the sand  
The other in the sea  
Did you dive until  
You didn't have to breathe?  
Lost beneath the waves  
Where I can't call your name  
I'm seasick on the beach

Marina won't you come back around?  
I'll wait here ‘til the moon goes down  
I thought I saw you floating away  
I guess I should have known you couldn't stay One foot in the sand  
The other in the sea

Did you dive until  
You didn't have to breathe?  
Lost beneath the waves  
Where I can't call your name  
I'm washed up on the beach

#### You’ll Catch Your Death

Past the yellow tape lines  
In the hall  
Is a single chalk outline  
Where I heard you fall

Coded in the message  
On the table  
Always second guessing  
What you had meant to say

Turn down the lights  
Close your eyes  
Slip away

You’re drowning inside  
While learning to fly  
Succumb to the cold  
You’ll catch your death  
Fall through the end  
With nothing to hide  
No leading the blind  
And fading to black  
Won’t bring you back

Catalog what’s hidden  
In the lines  
Piece together visions  
Of why you tried

Turn down the lights  
Close your eyes  
Slip away

#### Xs on Your Eyes

Over the railway bridge  
Kicking off the Sunday best  
Fist full of the sleeping pills  
Missing the entire mess

Speeding by a van  
Parked outside the house  
Breaking through the door  
To find you there but inside out

In a darkened room,  
Clutching for the switch  
Eyes are closed and waiting for  
The light to shine on

You took a breath and it held onto  
All the blood flow through your skin  
You wanted just to push it out  
You had no reasons to hold out

Xs on your eyes  
Blanked out from the bliss  
One step from the bathroom door  
And two from the abyss

There was no one there  
It seemed there never was  
Waited for a lifetime ‘til  
The light could shine on

You took a breath and it held onto  
All the blood flow through your skin  
You wanted just to push it out  
You had no reasons to hold out

All the things that you never had before  
No one gave to you things you needed more  
In a faded room passed out on the floor  
Finally you saw the light

You took a breath and it held onto  
All the blood flow through your skin  
You wanted just to push it out  
You had no reasons to hold out

You took a breath and it held onto  
Venom from the inside out  
You wanted just to keep it in  
You in the dark with no way out.

#### Flight Data Recorder

Inside voices please  
I was a child  
They built this monster  
With their own regrets

A vacuum-like machine  
That spins! And drills your head in!  
Tower? Please come in <crosstalk.> Do you read me?

All the time you have  
Won’t come back to you  
All the time you spend postponed

Centers for disease control  
Stop the bleeding  
In the end  
The king and pawn  
Go in the same box

All the time you spend  
Won’t come back to you  
When all the lies descend  
And lie undressed for you

With all the time you have  
There’s nothing else to lose  
When all the time you spend  
Won’t come back to you

All the time you have  
Won’t come back to you

#### Reeling in the Years

Straight from your heart  
So much confusion  
A shot across the bow  
And hurried decision

You never got it  
You never got it down

In the time since  
You thought about it  
Nothing’s changed much  
Except you submitted

To  
All the fears that were passed down to you  
And  
You’ll be reeling in the years to come

You never got it You never got it down

And on the eve  
Of the committed  
Still unsure of  
Why you submitted

To  
All the fears that were passed down to you  
So  
You’ll be reeling in the years to come  
And  
There is no way to prevent the flood  
While  
You insist on trying to chase the sun

You never got it  
You never got it down

<h3 id="pulled-punches-album">Pulled Punches</h3>

#### She's So Lost

With all the things I know  
I never would have guessed  
that when you let down your hair  
it is your last defense

You walk around and never give them any chance  
chance to see you alone and your ugly inside

When someone falls for you  
do you know how they feel?  
When they're waving white flags in the fields  
what do you see?

One day I'll call you up  
and you'll rush to the phone  
and I'll hear you alone  
and you're ugly inside

Take a walk around the lake  
let your hair blow in the wind  
cuz all you ever need to do  
is notice things other than you

Taste the coffee without cream  
drive your car at breakneck speed  
cuz all you ever need to do  
is notice things other than you.

#### Back and Forth

I want to make it so the action matters  
I want to realize the consequences  
I want to move in the right direction  
I want to make all the right decisions

I want a correlating interaction  
I want a first hand look at your reaction  
I want to be an optimistic person  
I want to pick up where the last time I reversed

So let's go!

<h3 id="jumping-the-tracks-album">Jumping the Tracks</h3>

#### Young Once

How can you not see you're gone?  
Like all the dead leaves when fall comes  
Why should you believe me now?  
When you're running in circles crusading and fleeing love

You were the young once  
Love devotees on trampolines

You're coming on denouement  
Nothing but deceit in your heart  
You'll be sadly the slated as no hope from C.P.R.  
Sadly the slated as no hope from C.P.R.

But you were the young once  
Love devotees on trampolines

#### The Bitterest Pill

Swallowed down  
The bitterest pill around,  
Dissolving into the veins and the heart can’t be rid of it now,  
And it does no good  
Even when it’s understood,  
It will remain and there isn’t a way to get it all out

Every single breath  
Making you more upset,  
Shutting it down is the way that you’ve found to prolong this slow death,  
And it does no good  
Even when it’s understood,  
It still remains and there isn’t a way to get it all out,

Footprints we left in the sand  
They just faded away too soon,  
Don’t know if you ever think about it  
But it’s all I do.

Time grows long  
Somehow you don’t move on,  
Cold is the comfort of knowing exactly what’s going wrong,  
And it does no good  
Even when it’s understood,  
Always the same you can’t think of a way to get it all out,

All of the things that we had  
They just faded away too soon,  
Don’t’ know if you ever think about it  
But it’s all I do.  
Resigned to defeat,  
So we’re doomed to repeat,  
What we’re going through,  
Don’t know if you ever think about it  
But it’s

All the venom that is spit off-handedly,  
A poison seeping slowly into the heart,  
And it’s overwhelming everything around us,  
Sets the teeth on edge as it slowly tears us apart,

I thought you should know.

All of the things that we had  
They just faded away too soon,  
Don’t’ know if you ever think about it  
But it’s all I do.  
We’re always stuck in the same old story, We don’t pull through.  
Don’t’ know if you ever think about it  
But it’s all I do.

#### Toe the Line

You never sway in the windy night  
You never sink in the rolling tide  
But now you’re drowning alone again,  
Uncomfortable in your own skin

So you put it under lock and key  
Using silence so accusingly  
And you’re lying in a separate bed,  
With insomnia instead of me,

(All you say that you want.)

Here we are after all these days,  
And it’s life that we while away,  
(All you say that you want.)  
Just a glance when we pass in the hall,  
We never break through the silence at all,  
(Have you got everything you want?)

And now it’s normal so there’s nothing to do,  
Just gotta try hard to make it through  
(All you say that you want.)  
And I’m lying in a separate bed,  
With insomnia instead of you,  
(Is it all you need?)

What do you do when it fades to nothing?  
You’re getting sore from sitting tight.  
Do you wait for another connection?  
It starts to kill you just to toe the line.  
It’s gonna kill you just to toe the line.

#### The Space Between Us

We knock on doors,  
When no one’s home,  
No cars and the yard is overgrown,

So we break in,  
Out of the cold,  
Desperate for warmth in the unknown,

And all those times rushing by,  
From here to infinity,

Swept out into the night,  
And they never come back again,

Take up arms choose your sides,  
We had this feeling years ago,

No way across the divide,  
It’s only space between us now.

And now it’s gone,  
Away from here,  
Lost and found, in faded years.

#### What Lies Ahead

She floats away now  
She's down to bed  
Wish I could keep you  
From the lies ahead

Just mind your head  
Please don't forget  
To shine light ahead  
On the lies ahead

What lies ahead  
What lies ahead  
The lies ahead  
Use light instead

#### Exorcising Your Ghost

In the night listening to you exhale,  
Lying beside you satisfied,

It’s a dream  
I’m trapped and there's no way out,  
Lost within endless doubt,  
So lost,

And there’s no point to get out,  
Nothing gained, going without,  
And I’m still waiting for the day when  
I wake up and I’m living.

Yeah I know,  
That’s what kills me the most:  
Exorcising your ghost for good

And there’s no point to set out,  
Nothing gained, going without,  
And I’m still waiting for the day when  
I wake up and I’m living.

And so what does it get you  
When you take away everything and you’re left alone?

Would it kill you  
If you were to make believe that you could still feel love?

Would it upset you?  
If I take away everything and it’s set in stone?

Would it kill you?  
If you were to make believe that you could still be loved?

#### Rewrite the Story

So far,  
Gliding along without intention,

Long gone,  
Blown by the breeze,  
Fields will lie fallow

Oh you don’t pay attention,  
That’s how you end up beat down,  
Sands slipping through,  
Waiting forever,

Don’t mind years passing by No time to notice

And find You don’t know how to rewrite the story

Oh you don’t pay attention,  
That’s how you end up beat down,

Floating away in space,  
No longer out of place,  
No longer feel the pull,  
Vanish without a trace,

And now it’s set ablaze,  
Nothing to hold you,

Downwind,  
The first place you land won’t be the last one

Oh you don’t pay attention  
To what you commit to,  
Tied down,  
Frozen by fear,  
Waiting forever.

#### There Goes My Love

Hate comes after denial  
And slowly eats into your head  
And you lose blood in your veins  
You're running out of love

It's so long and you're done  
It's so long now you've gone  
Right back out in two

There goes my love  
You know it couldn't wait  
Take everything when you leave now Broken by love I know you couldn't wait  
Make believe it's ok now

I hate I fell for you  
I doubt you ever knew  
That I could feel  
Up and down your spine  
When all of your measured love withdrew

It's so long and you're done  
It's so long now you've gone  
Right back out in two

There goes my love  
You know it couldn't wait  
Take everything when you leave now Broken by love I know you couldn't wait  
Make believe it's ok now

Yeah it's a light  
A light inside the walls surrounding you

#### Running the Distance

Looking afield for reasons to let go,  
Alone at the wheel,  
Distance yourself from me,

Caught in the breeze, a kite in a tree,  
Unable to leave,  
Tangled up all the while,

All the stars are gone,  
You waited all night long but you don’t see anything

Running the distance,  
I’m never able to keep stride,

Left it for dead,  
Buried at sea,  
Spiraling down,  
A ship run aground in the tide,

Caught in the breeze,  
A kite in a tree,  
Unable to leave,  
Tangled up all the while,

All the stars are gone,  
You waited all night long but you don’t see anything, That’s no lazy eye,  
Looking for the reasons why we lost everything

Running the distance  
I’m never able to keep stride.

#### No one can touch you now

Running through your disappearing act,  
Somehow I feel I have to persist,  
In bringing all the history back,  
You make sure I no longer exist,

Where’d you go to?  
No one can touch you now.

Silence is the natural refrain,  
It’s the only possible response,  
Frozen from that ice in your veins,  
That you refuse to ever let defrost,

Where’d you go to?  
No one can touch you now.

All you withdrew,  
All you don’t have now.

#### Jumping the Tracks

Hey,  
Should we take a holiday  
From being blown away?  
Cuz it’s always too late to start,  
When you feel you’ll be torn apart,  
Yeah you know we’ll be torn apart,

So we stand our ground and wait,  
For the apathy to take,  
One more day to feel less alive,  
Statuesque and crumbling inside,  
Yeah you know so gone all the while,

Hey,  
Gonna hide that heart away,  
(all the way to the end)  
Cuz we need that holiday,  
Don’t you feel we’re not coming back?  
(all the way to the end)  
Once we’re gone there’s no coming back,  
Yeah you know we’re jumping the tracks.

We’re colliding yet we’re splitting in two,  
But we’re so numb we don’t feel what to do,  
No way to keep us on.

Wait,  
Don’t you take that all away,  
Like you’ll never be OK,  
Cuz it’s too late to get it back,  
Once we’re gone there’s no coming back,  
Oh you know we’re jumping the tracks.

We’re colliding yet we’re splitting in two,  
But we’re so numb we don’t feel what to do,  
No way to keep us on,  
And we’re slowly fading into the blue,  
But we’re so numb we don’t feel what to do,  
No way to keep us on.

#### I'm A Little Teapot (Bonus)

Lately I've been a cauldron  
You should leave when all of the steam builds  
And my lid goes flying off When it rains down on us

Laying under shady tree  
Should calm your frayed nerves  
But it creeps into each of your veins  
And all of your blood begins to boil

Then it's raining on us  
Boiling rain down on us  
Acrid rain on us  
Leaves a stain on us

Lately I've been a cauldron  
Slowing stewing on low

<h3 id="summer-2019-extended-play-album">Summer 2019 : Extended Play</h3>

#### You Are One

You’re waiting forever  
It’s not gonna find you  
And all your obsessions  
Are not gonna blind you  

You are one  
When you are gone  
You are gone  
When you are one  

#### Driving Aimlessly

You don’t know me  
From a hole in the wall  
Let’s make some noise ‘til  
They break down the door  
You belong here with me  
We’ll be lost and innocent  
Could never see you alone  

Say you want me  
Sitting shotgun we’ll go  
Driving aimlessly  
While it’s twenty below  
And we’ll be lost in the waves  
We’ll be lost and innocent  
Could never see alone  

Am I too late  
Our hearts awake  
When you wait  
You sink down  

Don’t let me down  
In your heart  

#### Drawn Into the Sun

Open up and step inside  
to never realize  
Everything that was dragging you down  
Can’t leave it all behind  

Free to roam out on your own  
And never breaking stride  
A prisoner behind your eyes  
Even though they’re open wide  

You were drawn into the sun  
Just a ghost inside  
Never cast aside  
Calling out to everyone  
You were lost to time  
In the blink of an eye  

Wading through the rolling waves  
And never breaking stride  
Feel the pull into the sea  
And leave it all behind  

You were drawn into the sun  
Just a ghost inside  
Never cast aside  
Calling out to everyone  
You were lost to time  
In the blink of an eye  

#### Sugarcane (Redux)

You call for me now  
I’m on standby  
I’ll stay in line  
My eyes are blind  

And you knew you’d cause a landslide  
For your sugarcane  
Yeah you knew you’d cause a landslide  
For your sugarcane  

#### Safe Harbor

You were walking down the street from side to side  
Looking out for shooting stars to catch your eye  
And the only thing you seem to see  
Always fading out of view  

A map drawn out to show where water flows  
And everything seems overexposed  
And the only thing you seem to feel  
Is you don’t know what to do  

There’s an island somewhere down beneath the clouds  
Safe harbor in the fog if you come down  
But the only thing that seems quite real  
Always fading out of view  

Flying blind  
No map to reference how  
Oh why don’t you come down  
And interrupt my train of thought  
Don’t you see  
The curtain’s been undrawn  
Oh why don’t you come down  
And interrupt my train of thought

#### Borrowed Time

Earlier on we jump in side by side  
A common mission keeps us unified  

Years of dissatisfaction magnified  
By steady disaffection in our lives  

It’s all on Borrowed time  
It’s all wrong again  

Driving us to distraction  
Feel maligned  
Unable to take action  
Undermined  

It’s all on Borrowed time  
It’s all wrong  
Until we try  
It’s all wrong again  

#### Gondolier

I don’t mind if you go  
It’s been a good while  
And stasis only drags you down  
And I won’t mind if you come back around  
I will wait for you  
I will leave the light on  

and get you on your own  

I don’t mind if you say  
You’ve had enough of that  
At least you’re coming out of it   
And I won’t mind if you’re flailing around  
I will wait for you  
I will leave the light on  

To get you on your own  

There’s a cold wind blowing through your hair ( down the track )  
When you take initial steps anywhere ( don’t look back )  
No one’s brushing rocks toward the sides  
Without them, the path is too open wide  

So let’s raise a glass to when you’ve gone  
And hope that you’ve got what you need to get on  
Just remember when you’re wrestling with doubt  
That the light will never die out  

In the distance we will see  
You’re holding onto me  
But the story still unfolds  

‘Cuz I’ve journeyed through the years  
to meet the gondolier  
I hope you can let go  

I was waiting there for you  
Even though I could not follow  
And you’ll know just what to do  
Even when I cannot follow  

#### Driving Aimlessly (Redux)

You don’t know me  
From a hole in the wall  
Let’s make some noise ‘til  
They break down the door  
You belong here with me  
We’ll be lost and innocent  
Could never see you alone  

Say you want me  
Sitting shotgun we’ll go  
Driving aimlessly  
While it’s twenty below  
And we’ll be lost in the waves  
We’ll be lost and innocent  
Could never see you alone  

Am I too late?  
Our hearts awake  
When you wait  
You sink down  

#### Where I Hope We Get Lost

When we were  
We were so young  
A long way  
So much undone  

Will you wait  
When I can’t go on  
And on the way  
When plans go wrong  

Our fingers  
Tracing birthmarks  
A hedge maze  
Where I hope we get lost  

You wait when I can’t go on  
While we sink I can’t let on  
You wait when I can’t go on  
And on the way my hands holding on  

#### The Pull From Both Sides

Burning down  
A home completely to the ground  
Beneath the charred remains  
Will you be alright?  

All the fire  
Is channeled to a future life  
We chase away the time  
And hope it’s alright  

Breaking free  
Unraveling the knot to see  
you’re stretched out in between  
The pull from both sides  

Heed both calls  
But never realize it’s wrong  
We chase away the time  
And hope it’s alright  

And I will try to be all that you need  
And I will fight hard to be where you are  

#### Calling Off the Rescue

A flicker in the wick  
We know how this one ends  
This sturdy house of cards  
Comes crashing down on them  

A flicker in the wick  
We couldn’t feel a thing  
Stumble in the dark  
Heart under your sleeve  
We hear our moving lips  
But no one sees you speak  
Confessing all my love  
While you were fast asleep  

Calling off the rescue  
While we’re still lost  
They’re calling off the rescue  
While we’re still lost  
Calling off the rescue  
While we’re still lost  

#### Contempt

When we cross to the other side  
Feel secure that the knot is tied  
and we’re still aligned  

Always ever after  

Shelter from the bitter storm  
Insulation from the cold  
Keeps the welcome warm  

Always ever after  

And we’re adding fuel to the fire  
The embers glowing with a spark  
The concerns are wholly justified  
We misjudge the distance in the dark  

Seems as if we’ve lost control  
And contempt has taken hold  
But we never know  

Always ever after  

Grasping for a final chance  
Without fear of reprimand  
Before we let it go  

Always ever after  

And we’re adding fuel to the fire  
The embers glowing with a spark  
The concerns are wholly justified  
We misjudge the distance in the dark  

So we’re adding fuel to the fire  
The embers glowing with a spark  
The concerns are wholly justified  
Can’t judge the distance in the dark  

And we never know  
What will take hold  

#### Redrawn

We’re further afield than we had imagined  
No sense of direction and we lost our bearings  

Didn’t realize we got turned around  

We can’t perceive how far we have drifted  
It’s never a straight line the compass is spinning  

Didn’t realize we got turned around  
Can we save ourselves by running aground  

And all the things we said  
Begin to lose meaning  
When all we need to do  
Is forgotten so quickly  

We’re following maps that are being redrawn  
Every detour pulling us farther  

Didn’t realize we got turned around  
Can we save ourselves by running aground  

And all the things we said  
Begin to lose meaning  
When all we need to do  
Is forgotten so quickly  

No wonder we’ve drifted so far  
No wonder we end up off course  
Can we navigate by stars  
When we don’t know where we are  

#### Is It Over Now

Was it overhead or an undertow?  
If you see me flinch get out your phone  
Fall into the fog of faceless liaisons  
Where no one ever hears I was wrong  

All this is to say our so longs  
And sing is it over now?  
Over now  
Is it over now  
Over now  
Is it over now  
Over now  
Is it over now  
It’s over now
